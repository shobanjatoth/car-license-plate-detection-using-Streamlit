## 🚗 Car License Plate Detection Web App using Streamlit
This project is a real-time Car License Plate Detection System built with Streamlit, designed to detect and extract license plates from images and videos using deep learning.

## 🔍 Key Features:

YOLOv8-based Object Detection: Uses a trained YOLOv8 model (best.pt) to accurately detect vehicle license plates in real-time.

OCR Integration: Automatically reads the license plate number using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) once detected.

Image & Video Support: Upload images or video files to perform detection.

User-Friendly UI: Simple and interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.

Future Scope: Can be extended to fetch owner or vehicle details from a database or government API using the extracted plate number.
